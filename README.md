# Cursor MCP Knowledge-Adaptive Agent Framework

A comprehensive framework that enhances the Cursor IDE with an intelligent agent system capable of learning from your codebase, adapting to your development patterns, and providing context-aware assistance.

## Overview

This project implements an intelligent agent system that:

1. **Learns from your codebase** - Stores patterns, conventions, and best practices observed in your code
2. **Adapts to your development style** - Evolves its suggestions to match your established coding patterns
3. **Provides browser-based debugging tools** - Captures console logs, network activity, and UI states
4. **Maintains historical context** - Remembers past decisions and code changes
5. **Offers a REST API** - Access stored knowledge and documentation programmatically

## Key Features

### Knowledge Storage and Retrieval

- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies and stores recurring code patterns
- **Technology Adaptation**: Specializes in your project's tech stack
- **Context Awareness**: Builds understanding of your project architecture
- **Historical Memory**: Remembers past decisions and discussions

### Browser Debugging Tools

- **Console Monitoring**: Tracks JavaScript errors and warnings
- **Network Inspection**: Monitors API requests and responses
- **Visual Debugging**: Captures screenshots of UI states
- **DOM Analysis**: Inspects HTML elements and properties

### SQLite Database

Stores project knowledge in several tables:

- `agent_knowledge`: General knowledge about the codebase
- `code_patterns`: Recurring patterns found in the code
- `documentation`: Project documentation entries
- `interaction_history`: Record of agent-developer interactions
- `project_metrics`: Metrics and statistics about the project
- `project_status`: Status of various project components

### REST API

Access the stored knowledge through a Flask-based API:

- `/api/db/query`: Execute custom database queries
- `/api/db/status`: Get database information and schema
- `/api/docs`: Retrieve project documentation

## Setup and Usage

### Initial Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Run the MCP setup script:

```bash
python scripts/mcp_setup.py
```

This script will:
- Verify all required components are in place
- Set up the SQLite database with necessary tables
- Test the knowledge storage and retrieval system

### Using the Knowledge Storage

Store new knowledge:

```bash
python scripts/store_knowledge.py "category" "key" "value"
```

Retrieve knowledge:

```bash
python scripts/retrieve_knowledge.py "category" "key"
```

### Starting the API Server

Launch the REST API server:

```bash
python scripts/app.py
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Browser Tools Usage

The browser tools provide various debugging capabilities:

- Console log monitoring
- Network traffic inspection
- Screenshot capture
- DOM element selection

## Scripts Reference

- `db_setup.py`: Creates SQLite database and tables
- `db_save.py`: Saves data to database tables
- `db_query.py`: Executes queries against the database
- `store_knowledge.py`: Stores knowledge in `agent_knowledge` table
- `retrieve_knowledge.py`: Retrieves knowledge from `agent_knowledge` table
- `app.py`: REST API server for accessing the database
- `mcp_setup.py`: Verifies and initializes the MCP system
- `delete_knowledgebase.py`: Deletes the database (use with caution)

## System Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Flask
- SQLite3
