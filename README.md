# Project Workspace

This is a new project workspace where we'll be building according to your requirements.

## Project Structure

As we develop this project, we'll maintain:

- Clear organization of code
- Consistent coding patterns
- Documentation of key decisions
- Technology choices that align with project goals

## Getting Started

When you're ready to begin working on a specific feature or task, please provide details about:

1. The technology stack you prefer to use
2. Specific features or functionality you want to implement
3. Any existing code or frameworks we should integrate with

## Development Notes

This section will track key decisions and progress as we build this project together.

## MCP Setup

The Model-Cursor Protocol (MCP) has been set up to enhance our collaborative development process. This system:

- Tracks code patterns and project-specific knowledge in an SQLite database
- Adapts suggestions to match your established coding style
- Maintains historical context of decisions and code changes
- Enables more intelligent assistance as we continue to work together

The MCP utilizes the following components:
- Database initialization and management (`db_setup.py`, `db_save.py`, `db_query.py`)
- Knowledge storage and retrieval (`store_knowledge.py`, `retrieve_knowledge.py`)
- Main application interface (`app.py`)

This setup allows for continuous learning and improvement throughout our development process. # sasi
